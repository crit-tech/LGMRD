# Treasure Generator

Piles of coins, shining gems, and powerful relics hidden away in the depths of the world await adventurers brave enough to seek them. This section offers a simple set of tables and guidelines that let you quickly reward treasure for your fantasy RPG, and which work well alongside the more detailed treasure rules of the game.

## Gold Per Level

Use the following gold parcels to quickly reward adventuring groups based on the characters' average level. Reward four such parcels each level, or add parcels together to create larger rewards.

| Level       | Gold per Parcel             |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| 1st - 4th   | 100 gp (3d6 × 10 gp)        |
| 5th - 10th  | 1,300 gp (3d8 × 100 gp)     |
| 11th - 16th | 7,000 gp (2d6 × 1,000 gp)   |
| 17th - 20th | 70,000 gp (2d6 × 10,000 gp) |

This earned wealth can take the form of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and art objects as desired. You can also adjust the numbers slightly to keep hoards from looking too uniform. For example, you might turn two 1,300 gp parcels into 1,145 gp and 1,422 gp.

## Consumable Treasure

As desired, you can augment monetary treasure with consumable magic items from the following table.

Choose specific weapons and armor that fit the proficiencies and desires of the characters.

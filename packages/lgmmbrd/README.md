# The Lazy GM's 5e Monster builder Resource Document

This is the [Lazy GM's 5e Monster Builder Resource Document](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_5e_monster_building_resource_document.html) as a JavaScript package (both ESM and CommonJS supported).

## Usage

### ESM

```js
import lgmmbrd from "@crit-tech/lgmmbrd";

console.log(lgmmbrd);
```

Or, you may want to import it asynchronously so it's not part of your main bundle:

```js
import("@crit-tech/lgmmbrd").then((lgmmbrd) => {
  console.log(lgmmbrd);
});
```

### CommonJS

```js
const lgmmbrd = require("@crit-tech/lgmmbrd");

console.log(lgmmbrd);
```

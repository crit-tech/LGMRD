        "### The Tangles\n\n**Area Aspects:** Poisonous tangleweed, sinkholes, statues of ancient lords\n\n> *A narrow path leads up a rocky slope to the broken stone walls of the Lonely Torch watchtower. A two-foot-thick carpet of glistening green-and-violet weeds and thorny brambles surrounds the stony hill on which the tower sits. Statues of forgotten nobility peer out from the tangled vines.*\n\nTangleweed is an invasive, poisonous plant that can lash out against creatures passing close by. Any creature that moves through the tangleweed without protection must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. A character with a medical background can spend 10 minutes to aid the victim and attempt a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the afflicted character is no longer poisoned. Covering one’s boots in urine repels the tangleweed and negates the need for a saving throw.\n\nA **shambling mound** (known as Strangleberries by the Night Blades) might be seen wandering through the tangleweed, but this creature is generally not aggressive. Like the tangleweed, it can be repelled by urine.\n\n### Shattered Door\n\n**Area Aspects:** Ironbound wooden door, grinning gargoyle, narrow arrow slits\n\n> *The thin path rising through the tangleweed leads up to an ironbound wooden door at the front of the ruined tower. A stone gargoyle juts out from above the door, its mouth open to reveal that its tongue has been broken off. Arrow slits are cut into the rough stone walls of the tower, angled toward the path where it leads up to the door.*\n\nTwo Night Blade **guards** (Osgood and Pulk) are meant to watch over this door by peering out the arrow slits from inside the tower. However, they are often either too drunk or too engaged in a game of knucklebones to notice anyone who doesn’t make a lot of noise while approaching. The door is strong ironbound oak and is barred from the inside. The magic that once animated the door’s gargoyle guardian has faded, but the residual spark of that magic allows the gargoyle to speak. The gargoyle is lonely for company, and aware of much of the activity undertaken by those inside\\\nthe tower. The bandits have long since ignored the chatty guardian.\n\n### Broken Hall\n\n**Area Aspects:** Collapsed beams, broken floor, headless statue of warrior\n\n> *Large oaken beams have collapsed from where they once supported the vaulted ceiling of this hall. One has smashed through the floor, revealing basement passages below. A large headless statue of a warrior, its greatsword clasped hilt-up in its hands, stands at the far side of the hall. A stone staircase leads up to the higher floors of the tower.*\n\nIn addition to the guards described above, four Night Blade **bandits** (Sanda Sixtoes, Polard the Mule, Julette, and Longtooth) sometimes reside in this hall when preparing for an imminent attack, or when they need to get out of the stagnant air in the basement levels. They avoid the stirges above, which they call “the Night Lord’s children.” While in this hall, the characters might hear commotion from below but they hear nothing but silence from above.\n\n### Shadowed Reaches\n\n**Area Aspects:** Hanging curtains of moss, collapsed walls, painted ceiling\n\n> *Sections of the walls of this upper level of the tower have collapsed from centuries of decay. Much of the stone ceiling has likewise fallen, leaving the tower open to the elements above. An old yet still beautiful fresco painting covers what remains of the ceiling, but much of it is shrouded by curtains of moss.*\n\nTen **stirges** lurk behind the cover of the moss, hoping that living creatures will come close enough to feed their insatiable appetites. The Night Blades know to stay out of this chamber, since only Gardren is safe from attack by these monsters.\n\n### Sunken Cellars\n\n**Area Aspects:** Crumbling stone ceiling, wooden beam supports, ragged bedrolls and hammocks\n\n> *The floor of the tower has collapsed, revealing stairs leading to a series of stone chambers below. Cracked wooden support beams hold up the crumbling stone ceiling of the main chamber, whose walls are lined with hammocks and bedrolls. A stone door, carved with an artful depiction of hooded priests, stands at the opposite end of the hall, while a natural tunnel leads off to the right.*\n\nDepending on the time of day, four Night Blade **bandits** (Terra, Duke, Ashe Dragonknuckle, and Two-Cups) and two **thugs** (Victor and Kingsteeth) might be sleeping here. They are generally not alert unless a significant amount of noise has been made upstairs. The carved doorway leads into the lost shrine, while the natural tunnel leads to the mud pit.\n\n### Mud Pit\n\n**Area Aspects:** Slick mud walls, mud pool floor, drainpipe, knotted rope\n\n> *A narrow walkway leads to the lip of a ten-foot-deep pit filled with mud. An ancient drainpipe roughly two feet in diameter is closed off by steel bars and trickles fetid water into the pool. A knotted rope hangs from an iron hook hammered into the natural stone wall.*\n\nTwo Night Blade **bandits** (Pelpe and Klive Yellowriver) guard this cavern while Ralavaz languishes in the mud, imprisoned and tormented here by his brother Gardren until he comes to his senses and demonstrates a willingness to return to his former life as a bandit and murderer. One of the bandits has a large bag filled with a **swarm of rats**, which he uses to torment Ralavaz. If attacked, the bandit dumps out this bag to add to the chaos.\n\nIf Ralavaz is rescued, he reveals that he returned to the Lonely Torch after finding out that his brother Gardren was alive and leading a new group of Night Blades. Ralavaz had hoped to turn Gardren away from murder and banditry, but his failure to do so saw him incarcerated here.\n\n### Lost Throne\n\n**Area Aspects:** Kneeling armored statues, stone throne on dais, burning stone braziers, wide well leading down into shadow\n\n> *Two hulking statues of faceless armored knights kneel in the corners of the room, facing the center of the chamber and a well there that leads down into the shadowy depths. A stone throne sits upon a raised dais opposite the door.*\n\nGardren, a **bandit captain**, and four Night Blade **bandits** (Avrin, Ragia, Thorn, and Sasha) are usually found in this hall, sorting through recently stolen goods or planning their next attacks. Gardren’s pet stirge Heartspine hides in the corner and attacks any character who attacks its master. This stirge has 10 hit points and a Dexterity (Stealth) modifier of +5.\n\nGardren wields a *+1 shortsword* called *Nightculler*—a silvered weapon with a draconic pommel and a line of black onyx along the fuller of the blade. A character attuned to the sword is able to cast the darkness spell, requiring no components. Once this feature is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.",

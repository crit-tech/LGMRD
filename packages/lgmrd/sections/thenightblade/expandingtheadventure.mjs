You can also replace the tower with the “Dark Abbey” location from *Sly Flourish’s Fantastic Locations*, dropping in many additional areas for the characters to explore.\n\nIt’s also possible that the story of Ralavaz and Gardren doesn’t end with this adventure. Depending on how Ralavaz wants to make amends for his past crimes, he might have his own quests that he hopes to have the characters follow.",

        "> *Light rain falls, and a gloomy mist covers the landscape. A large tree has fallen across the road, crushing a wagon under its great weight. More fallen trees lie at the sides of the road.*\n\nSix **bandits** (Artur, Dobarn, Kirci, Dorra, Rhuda and Tasty Pete) lurk at the sides of the road, hiding near the fallen trees and ready to rob passersby. If the characters approach the wagon, one of the bandits shouts out,\n\n> *“Your weapons and belongings! Drop them to the ground, and in the name of the Night Blades, we’ll spare your lives!”*\n\nIf convinced or goaded into speaking, the bandits reveal that they are eager to look good in the eyes of their leader the Night Lord, who waits for their return at the Lonely Torch.\n\nWhen the battle is over, the characters can approach local villagers in Whitesparrow to learn some of the information regarding the Night Blades given in the “Secrets and Clues” section. Eventually, the party is approached by Sheriff Willowmane, who hires the characters to root out the Night Blades and bring their newly returned leader Ralavaz to justice.\n\n### Customizing the Bandits\n\nThis adventure includes battles against a lot of bandits. To keep things fresh, we’ve included a few names for these bandits. Feel free to customize those foes by changing their appearance, gender, or weapons, and to substitute names of your own. Consider tying some of these bandits to NPCs the characters might know or have met. Describe some as being small and fast and others as large and strong. Do what you can to make each bandit unique and interesting.\n\n[![](https://slyflourish.com/images/Night_Blades_30_x_25.jpg)](https://slyflourish.com/images/Night_Blades_30_x_25.jpg)\n\nNight Blade Map by Chris Wilson released under a [CC0 License](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) and available for Commercial Use.",

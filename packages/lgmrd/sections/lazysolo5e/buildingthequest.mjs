Choose a name and any other details from the "[NPC Generator](25-npcgenerator.md)" section.\n\nNext, roll on the Quests in "[Core Adventure Generators](24-coreadventuregenerators.md)". Determine the location by rolling on the Condition, Description, Origin, and Location table.\n\nChoose a map for the location from your favorite online source of maps or any other maps you have on hand. Choose a map that fits the location. Maps with fifteen or more rooms work best for adventures created with these guidelines.\n\nYou can then fill in additional quest details from the other tables in "[Core Adventure Generators](24-coreadventuregenerators.md)". Examples include required keys, monuments, villains, lieutenants, and other quest goals.\n\nChoose a starting room on the map that makes sense.',

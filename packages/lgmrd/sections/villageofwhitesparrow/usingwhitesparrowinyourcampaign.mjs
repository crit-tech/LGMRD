        "The village of Whitesparrow serves as the hub for\\\nthe adventures in this book, so as to save on the space required to write a new starting location for each adventure, and to give the characters a well-defined home base. The design of the village is both straightforward and spare, featuring an inn, a tavern, an outfitters, a sheriff, and the village lord. Whitesparrow has thus been designed to fit easily into any fantasy world—but also to be completely replaceable with any settlement of your choice from your own campaign word, another published adventure, or a larger published campaign setting. Use the village as is, modify it to suit your own campaign, or throw it out and replace it completely.\\\nIt’s up to you.",

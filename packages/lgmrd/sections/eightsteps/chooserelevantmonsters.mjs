        "What monsters are the characters most likely to face? What monsters make sense for a specific location and situation? We're using the term \"monster\" loosely here, so as to include enemy NPCs as well as truly monstrous foes. Whatever type of enemy you need, reading through books of monsters can give you the fuel to choose the right creatures for the right situation.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the loose relationship between monster challenge rating and character level can help you understand how a battle might go. Most of the time, you can just list a number of monsters and improvise encounters based on what's happening in the adventure. For boss battles, you might have to do more work. See [Lazy Combat Encounter Building](15-lazycombatencounterbuilding.md) for more information.",
